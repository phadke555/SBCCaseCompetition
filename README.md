# SBCCaseCompetition

As part of the Sustainable Business Club's Case Competition at UNC Chapel Hill, our team created a strategic solution for demand generation for a hypothetical EV company named GreenDrive's expansion into international markets such as India. We conducted market research and then proposed a solution taking into account marketing as well as strategic partnerships and incentives to attract new EV consumers in India.

Our proposal placed 2nd in the Case Competition.
